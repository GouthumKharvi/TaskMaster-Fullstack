 🚀 TaskMaster – Full-Stack Task Board

TaskMaster is a clean, full-stack task management application built using **FastAPI** (Python) and **React + Tailwind CSS**.  
It was developed as part of a **Vibe Coding Assignment (60 minutes)** to demonstrate rapid full-stack development, clean API design, and a polished, user-friendly interface.

The focus of this project is **simplicity, clarity, and good engineering judgment**, rather than over-engineering.

## 🔌 Backend API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/tasks` | Fetch all tasks |
| POST | `/api/tasks` | Add a new task |
| PATCH | `/api/tasks/{id}/toggle` | Toggle task completion |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Delete a task |

> Tasks are stored **in memory** and persist only during runtime, as required.
